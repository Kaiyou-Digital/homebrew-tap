  # NOTE: `postflight` is deprecated in favor of `postflight_steps`, but its
  # `run` step doesn't resolve `appdir` (or any base) inside `args:` — only
  # the command path itself, stdin/stdout/chdir, and writable_paths get
  # path-base substitution. There's no way to express "run pluginkit with
  # the installed app's plugin path as an argument" without it. Third-party
  # taps keep (temporary) compatibility with this legacy block; switching to
  # postflight_steps here would raise `undefined local variable or method
  # 'appdir'` and silently fail to register the QuickLook extension.
